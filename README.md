# ODE Project â€” Python Simulation & Practical Circuit


## Introduction
To utilize what we've learned in the ODE (ordinary differential equation) course, we propose a circuit consist of several electronic component, and dive into the mathematics (ODE) behind this circuit.

We use Python to do **visualization (animation) and computation** of our practical circuit.
